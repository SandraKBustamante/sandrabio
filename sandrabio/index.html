Hello, I’m Sandra Bustamante!

I’m a traditional and computer-based animator currently residing in Boston. I study Visual Media Arts production at Emerson College. I also work in animation, drawing, motion graphics and photography. In my free time I am reading comics, playing video games or hanging out with my pet monkey. 



I was born in Puebla, Mexico and grew up in Los Angeles, California. My journey began at childhood watching animated shows or films by artists. Doodling in my notebooks since then, I aspire to make works for younger audiences. My goal is to teach kids important lessons while giving them worlds full of imagination.



Social justice is important to my work. I am passionate about highlighting the diverse stories of marginalized groups and the struggles they face. My art will focus on women, people of color, LGBT members, mental illness, disabilities, and poverty.



Previously, I have worked with cultural organizations at Emerson College like Flawless Brown or Amigos. I have also worked on production of a collaboration between Emerson and Armani. I am open to working with anyone and if you think I’m the right fit for you feel free to contact me.
