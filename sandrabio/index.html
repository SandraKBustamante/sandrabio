Sandra Bustamante

I study Visual Media Arts production at Emerson College. My specialization is in 3D

animation and drawing for animation.

 

I work in:  

Motion Graphics
Photography
Drawings
3D/2D Animations 


I would like to work on projects for younger audiences. My goal is to teach kids important lessons while giving them worlds full of imagination. I’m inspired by artists such as Guillermo Del Toro, Chris Sanders, Bruce Timm, and John Lasseter.



My work focuses on stories about:

Social Justice
POC
LGBTQ+
Mental illness
Disabilities


In my free time, I’m participating in local activism, reading comics or playing with my pet monkey.
